# Deep Neural Network for Classification
Summary of the Deep learning code in Andrew Ng's course

This is a classification example by using of deep neural network. In the previous example we made a simple model by Logistic Regression as a Neural Network with 70 percent accuracy. Know we want to improve the model. This is a classification problem with a result of cat and non-cat images.

Two possible models
1- A 2-layer neural network
2- An L-Layer deep neural network

At the first part, we will write a code which is composed of 2 hidden layers. At the first layer we have used the RELU activation function and at the seccond layer we used the Sigmoid to produce the classification results. Then we expand this code to L number of hidden layers. We want to see does accucy increases by increasing of the number of layers or not?
